HOMEWORK #2
Write a function that will take an array of 5 numbers as an argument and return the sum.

Print it in the console or in alert

BONUS: Write another function called validateNumber() that checks if a number is a valid number and call it for every number. If one of the numbers of the array is invalid show an error message instead of a result.
